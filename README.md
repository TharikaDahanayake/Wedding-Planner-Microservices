# Wedding Planner Microservices

## Everyday is a learning day !

## Overview
The Wedding Planner Microservices system is designed to manage wedding events efficiently using a microservices-based architecture. It helps planners organize events, manage guests, and track tasks through independent services connected via an API Gateway. This approach improves scalability, flexibility, and maintainability. The system centralizes wedding planning activities while allowing each service to operate independently and communicate securely through REST APIs.

## Features

- Centralized API Gateway for routing and security.
- Event management for wedding ceremonies and related events.

- Task management to plan, assign, and monitor wedding-related tasks.
- Scalable and loosely coupled microservices architecture.
